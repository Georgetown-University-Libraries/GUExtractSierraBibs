### Purpose
The Georgetown University Libraries provide quarterly, monthly, and daily extracts our catalog data to the Washington Regional Library Consortium (WRLC).  Prior to the creation of this program, these files were generated by our Systems Librarian using Sierra client functionality.  This program was written in order to reduce the staff time required to produce these data files and to increase the frequency of delivery of these files.
